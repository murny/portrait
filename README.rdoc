= portrait

Portrait is a web service which converts a website into a image. The actual hard work is handled by Google's {Puppeteer}[https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer].  Portrait is primarily designed to be used as a service, but does have a minimal admin interface.

== Dependencies
You'll need to be able to run Puppeteer via Node.js (v7.6.0+). You'll also need to be able to run a Rails stack. Portrait is built on Ruby 2.3.3 and Rails 5.2

== Installation

The provided setup script should take care of all the necessities: installing dependencies, setting up a database, and creating a temporary admin user.

  $ ./bin/setup

Once that completes successfully, spin up a rails server

  $ rails server

And visit http://localhost:3000

== How it works

Send a POST request like below. Use basic http authorization and provide a parameter named +site[url]+. You can test it with curl:

  curl -X POST -d "site[url]=https://google.com" -H "Accept: application/json" http://admin:admin@localhost:3000/sites

On a valid url, you'll get a json response like this:

  {
    "site": {
      "id": 1,
      "status": "succeeded",
      "image": {
        "url": ".../1.png"
      }
    }
  }
